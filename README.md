# Resizer
An image resizing utility for my photography needs.

It's a tool that takes in a folder and resizes all of the images inside it to a resolution of `1920x1280` pixels while preserving the orientation.

It's very limited cause it's made to fit my workflow so I don't recommend using it right now. You can still have a look around if you wish... ðŸ˜‰

## Prerequisites
The tool uses `OpenCV` for image processing, so make sure to have that installed on your system before using it.
